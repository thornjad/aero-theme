;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The Aero themes are a pair of light and dark themes which balance elegance
;; with practicality. They were originally part of [Aero
;; Emacs](https://gitlab.com/thornjad/aero) but were distilled for wider use.

;; Installation:
;;
;; The Aero themes are not available on MELPA at this time, since they're still
;; undergoing some tweaking, and I'm not sure MELPA really needs more themes
;; right now.
;;
;; The easiest method of installation, if you have it set up already, is with
;; `straight.el' and `use-package':
;;
;;     (use-package aero-theme
;;       :straight (:host gitlab :repo "thornjad/aero-theme" :branch "main"))
;;
;; Alternatively, this repository may be cloned into your Emacs's
;; `custom-theme-directory'.
;;
;; Either way, activate the theme with `(load-theme 'aero-light)' or
;; `(load-theme 'aero-dark)', et voil√†!.
