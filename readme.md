# aero-dark-theme - A practical dark theme

_Author:_ Jade Michael Thornton<br>
_Version:_ 1.2.2<br>

The Aero themes are a pair of light and dark themes which balance elegance
with practicality. They were originally part of [Aero
Emacs](https://gitlab.com/thornjad/aero) but were distilled for wider use.

This is the dark companion to the light `aero-theme`. See ./aero-theme.el and
./readme.md for more information.
